/* The macro is set up to assume all the variable names are as we have defined 
them here, and that the macro is used on diagnosis data from the DNPR, ie
ICD-10 codes will have a "D" prefix (ie is a SKS code). By default the macro 
will use all diagnoses prior to the index date to calculate the CCI. Or more
precisely, all data up to 200 years before the index date. */

/*******************************************************************************
EXAMPLE - USE OF MACRO PARAMETERS
*******************************************************************************/

/* 
1) If the diagnosis data is not from the DNPR, ie the diagnosis codes is a 
true mixture of ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes, this can be specified by setting 
"code_type = icd". 
2) Since we now want to use the diag_code_icd variable from the
diag dataset, we also need to set "diag_code = diag_code_icd" to use the 
correct variable in the diag data. 
3) In many cases, the lookback period is set to a fixed period, which we can 
specify by using the lookback_length and lookback_unit parameters. Here we 
choose to use a 6 month lookback period which we can specify using 
"lookback_length = 6" and "lookback_unit = month".
4) In some cases we don't want to include auxiliary variables from the 
<pop_ds> input datatset. We can achieve that by specifying "keep_pop_vars = n". 
5) It is sometime convenient to have access to the individual disease groups 
used to calculate the CCI. We can keep the 19 individual variables used in the 
definition by using "keep_cci_vars = y". 
6) In some scenarios, it is desirable to be able to exclude one or more of the
disease groups from the CCI calculations. We can do this by using the 
exclude_groups parameter. Here we exclude Metastatic solid tumour and AIDS from 
the calculation by using "exclude_groups = 18 19". The definition and
corresponding number for each group can be found in the "CODES" section of the 
macro. */

there is no official consensus on what the "correct codes" are. Modifications
